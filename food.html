        <h2>Feeding Your Cat</h2>
        <p>When it comes to food, your cat needs a balanced and nutritional diet as well as lots of fresh, clean water to stay happy and healthy.</p>

          <h3>HOW MUCH FOOD DOES YOUR CAT NEED&#63;</h3>
          <p>Perhaps the largest error cat owners make with their pet&#39;s diet is in feeding too much. Many vets, in fact, say that obesity is the most prevalent nutritional disease seen in cats. ABC news has even reported that 1 of every 3 cats in Australia is obese. And the Australian Veterinary Association reports that pet obesity can lead to illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes, liver disease and arthritis.</p>

          <p>So how much food does your cat need to avoid becoming a fat cat&#63;</p>
          <!--2017. "Cat Food: A Balanced Diet for Your Cat." Love That Pet. Accessed April 23, https://www.lovethatpet.com/cats/food-and-diet/diet/.-->
          <p>That depends upon a number of factors&#59; you should get your vet&#39;s recommendation for your cat. In general, though, a calorie intake of around 25	&ndash; 30 calories per pound of body weight per day is enough for most cats.</p>

          <h3>CANNED OR KIBBLE&#63;</h3>
          <p>Kibble &ndash; dry cat food &ndash; is very popular among cat owners. But dried cat food is rapidly becoming less popular with veterinarians.</p>
          <!--2017. "Cat Food: A Balanced Diet for Your Cat." Love That Pet. Accessed April 23, https://www.lovethatpet.com/cats/food-and-diet/diet/.-->
          <p>Canned cat food, on average, is about 70&#37; water &ndash; about the same percentage of water that a meal of mouse would provide. And kibble is only about 10&#37; water. So if you feed your cat primarily a diet of kibble, you could be setting it up for urinary tract problems down the road due to a lack of water in its diet.</p>

          <h3>CLEAN, FRESH WATER</h3>
          <p>You should always have clean, fresh water available for your pet to drink.</p>
          <!--2017. "Cat Food: A Balanced Diet for Your Cat." Love That Pet. Accessed April 23, https://www.lovethatpet.com/cats/food-and-diet/diet/.-->
          <p>If you locate the water in locations where your cat likes to hang out, it will be more likely to drink its fill when needed. You might even consider distributing several water containers throughout the house, locating them in the cat&#39;s favourite areas.</p>
