        <p>From bedding and carriers to kitty litter and toys we take a look at all the equipment essentials you&rsquo;ll need to care for your feline friend.</p>

          <h3>KITTY LITTER</h3>
          <p>One of the perks of having a cat is that they&rsquo;re inclined by nature to &lsquo;go&rsquo; in the same area each time. No poop&#45;scooping missions in your backyard will be necessary. But that means you&sbquo;ll need to have a litter box for your cat.</p>

          <h3>BEDDING</h3>
          <p>Cats like to have a place to call their own for sleeping. Whatever you buy should be soft and warm. It might be as simple as a pillow, but lots of cats show a preference for nest&#45;type beds &#40;usually shaped somewhat like a donut&#41;.</p>

          <h3>SCRATCHING POSTS</h3>
          <p>Cats love to scratch. They need to scratch. And they WILL scratch&#59; it&#39;s instinctive! The only question is&#58; What will your cat scratch&#63; The smart move is to give your cat something that it will love to scratch, and that&#39;s made for scratching.</p>
          <!--Bright, Eloise. 2017. "Cat Equipment Basics: What You Need." Love That Pet. Accessed April 23, https://www.lovethatpet.com/cats/getting-started/equipment/.-->
          <p>It should be sturdy and stable. A cat can hit a post hard in a vigorous play attack, so you want to be sure that the post will remain in place and upright. A rubber base might be helpful.</p>

          <h3>TOYS</h3>
          <p>Kittens are playful critters, and playtime is an important component in their development. Cat toys are great playtime tools, and just about any purpose	&#45;built toy that your cat enjoys will be fine. Just be sure that the cat can&#39;t get any small pieces off the toy. Anything smaller than a ping&#45;pong ball should be considered a potential choking threat.</p>

      <section>
          <h3>CARRIER</h3>
          <p>Be sure to also buy a cat carrier. It&#39;s the only safe way to transport your cat, even if you don&#39;t plan any trips longer than to the nearest vet. A loose cat in a car is NOT a good thing! Again, you&#39;ll be faced with a bewildering array of choices. Just make sure that the carrier you choose is well ventilated and sturdy.</p>
